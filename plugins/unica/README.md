# Unica Plugin

Unica models day-to-day 1C:Enterprise development workflows and exposes one
public stdio MCP server named `unica`. Prompt-visible skills call native
`unica.*` tools; bundled analyzers, runners, indexes, and the standards adapter
remain private implementation details.

One plugin directory serves both Codex and Claude Code. Each host reads its own
manifest, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
ignores the other.

## Public installation

Prerequisites are Git and one host: Codex CLI, or Claude Code 2.1.69 or newer.
Node.js, Python, download utilities, and archive utilities are not consumer
dependencies.

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add IngvarConsulting/unica-marketplace --ref main
codex plugin add unica@unica
```

Open a new Codex task after install or update. Update with:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade unica
codex plugin remove unica@unica
codex plugin add unica@unica
```

On Claude Code the catalog is added without a ref, and skills appear under the
plugin namespace as `/unica:<skill>`:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add IngvarConsulting/unica-marketplace
claude plugin install unica@unica
```

Claude Code 2.1.68 and earlier reject the catalog's `git-subdir` source type and
cannot load it at all; 2.1.69 is the first release that accepts it.

## Legacy transition boundary

Unica `v0.7.8` is the immutable migration bridge. A local, duplicated, or
otherwise legacy installation must first run the published
[`install-unica.sh`](https://github.com/IngvarConsulting/unica/releases/download/v0.7.8/install-unica.sh)
or
[`install-unica.ps1`](https://github.com/IngvarConsulting/unica/releases/download/v0.7.8/install-unica.ps1).

Unica `v0.8.0` supports ordinary marketplace updates only from canonical
`v0.7.5`, canonical `v0.7.6`, canonical `v0.7.7`, canonical `v0.7.8`, and technical
`0.7.x` installations.
The version string alone does not make a local or duplicated installation
canonical.

Uninstall with:

```sh
codex plugin remove unica@unica
codex plugin marketplace remove unica
```

## DCS naming migration

The release containing [issue #158](https://github.com/IngvarConsulting/unica/issues/158)
atomically replaces the transliterated `skd` domain with the official
**Data Composition System (`dcs`)** term. There is no deprecated alias:

| Removed contract | Canonical contract |
| --- | --- |
| `unica.skd.compile` | `unica.dcs.compile` |
| `unica.skd.edit` | `unica.dcs.edit` |
| `unica.skd.info` | `unica.dcs.info` |
| `unica.skd.validate` | `unica.dcs.validate` |
| `skd-compile/edit/info/validate` | `dcs-compile/edit/info/validate` |

The operation arguments and `DataCompositionSchema` XML format are unchanged.

## Read-only output migration

The release containing [issue #191](https://github.com/IngvarConsulting/unica/issues/191)
removes caller-controlled file sinks from read-only MCP tools. The affected
`info`/`validate` tools no longer accept `OutFile` or `outFile`, and
`unica.mxl.decompile` no longer accepts `OutputPath` or `outputPath`. There is
no compatibility alias: these arguments are rejected as contract errors.

Reports, exact raw DCS queries, and the MXL JSON DSL are returned in the MCP
response. Consumers must read `stdout`/structured response data instead of
reading a file created by Unica. If a durable artifact is needed, the caller
must save the returned value explicitly outside the read-only tool contract.

## Logical source target migration

Tools migrate to one logical target, one merge request at a time. There is no
deprecated alias:

| Tool | Removed selector | Canonical selector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unica.code.patch` | `path` + `sourceDir` | `sourceSet` + `metadataPath` |
| `unica.meta.info` | `ObjectPath` / `Path` | `sourceSet` + `metadataPath` |

Calls that still pass a removed field fail with `legacy_target_removed` and
name the canonical replacement. The logical selector addresses existing
Platform XML Configuration and Extension targets; Unica resolves the physical
`*Module.bsl` or descriptor location privately. `unica.meta.info` also stops
accepting `Detailed`, which it never read.

`unica.source.resolve` finds an address by name, and `unica.source.locate`
converts a path discovered by other means into one.

## Runtime delivery

The marketplace plugin contains skills, references, assets, `launch.sh`, and
three small native bootstrap binaries. It contains no full `bin/<target>` tool
runtime. Packaged `.mcp.json` invokes a command-scoped Git alias. Git's shell
runs `bootstrap/launch.sh`, which selects exactly one bootstrap:

- `darwin-arm64`;
- `linux-x64`;
- `win-x64` under Git for Windows.

The alias resolves the plugin root from whichever host it runs under. Claude
Code rewrites `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` before the shell sees it; Codex leaves the
token unset, and the shell falls back to Git's own `$PWD`/`$GIT_PREFIX` pair.
One launcher therefore serves both hosts without a per-host package.

The bootstrap reads the release-pinned `runtime-manifest.json`, downloads
`unica-runtime-<target>.tar.gz`, verifies archive and file SHA-256 values, and
publishes the runtime atomically in the host cache. It then execs the single
`unica` MCP process. Runtime stdout stays reserved for JSON-RPC; bootstrap
diagnostics use stderr.

The cache is `$CODEX_HOME/unica/runtimes` under Codex and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runtimes` under Claude Code, which survives plugin
updates. Packaged `.mcp.json` passes the Claude token through
`UNICA_RUNTIME_CACHE_DIR`; a host that does not substitute it forwards the
literal token, and the bootstrap discards any value that still contains `${`
rather than creating a directory named after it.

The runtime archive contains the target's `unica`, `bsl-analyzer`, `v8-runner`,
`rlm-tools-bsl`, and `rlm-bsl-index` binaries plus the generated
`third-party/manifest.json`. Internal launches re-check the pinned binary hash.

## Skills

The `skills/` tree covers configuration and extension metadata, forms, roles,
DCS/MXL, command interfaces, EPF/ERF and BSP registration, database/build
workflows, BSL search and diagnostics, integrations, background jobs,
performance, security, data separation, release support, autonomous runtime,
platform help, and logical source-resource inspection with a guarded BSL
replacement fallback.

It also covers applied-solution design, where the question is what to build
rather than how to write it: choosing the object class and typing its attributes
(`metadata-modeling`), designing registers (`register-design`), what a document
records and under which locks (`document-posting`), which event handler owns a
piece of logic (`object-events`), the managed form module and its client/server
boundary (`form-events`), which module hosts a procedure
(`module-placement`), the transaction, lock and responsible-read rules the
others defer to (`transactions-locks`), and concurrent editing of one object by
several users (`object-locks`).

## Local development

The source tree intentionally contains no generated tool binaries. Source
`.mcp.json` starts `cargo run --manifest-path ../../Cargo.toml --bin unica`.
Build a current-host development package under the distinct `unica-dev`
marketplace with:

```sh
scripts/dev/install-local-unica.sh
```

On native Windows x64, run the script from **Git Bash** included with 64-bit Git
for Windows. The local build requires Python 3.10 or newer, stable Rust with the
native MSVC toolchain, Microsoft C++ Build Tools, and the Windows SDK. A current
Codex CLI is required for the install and fresh-prompt verification steps.

WSL keeps Linux semantics and builds `linux-x64`. MSYS2 and Cygwin are not
supported shells for this installer; use Git Bash.

Useful flags:

```sh
scripts/dev/install-local-unica.sh --skip-build
scripts/dev/install-local-unica.sh --skip-install
scripts/dev/install-local-unica.sh --marketplace-name unica-dev
```

Claude Code loads a plugin directory directly, so the source tree needs no
marketplace and no install step:

```sh
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/unica
```

To package a current-host Claude debug build instead, pass
`--local-debug-host claude` to `scripts/ci/package-unica-plugin.py`.

## Release pipeline

The source workflow builds tools and `unica-bootstrap` natively on each runner,
creates deterministic runtime archives and checksum metadata, re-downloads
published release bytes for verification, and emits one thin marketplace
payload carrying both host catalogs. A separate workflow opens a plugin-only
staging PR in `IngvarConsulting/unica-marketplace`. After that commit is tagged
immutably, a catalog-only promotion PR points both stable `git-subdir` entries,
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for Codex and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
for Claude Code, to the tag.

The public catalog is never promoted before the source assets, staging commit,
and immutable marketplace tag exist.
